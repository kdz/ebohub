    <h1>About EboHub</h1>
    <p>EboHub is an SMS-based service for an Ebola-striken area with a population using
        primarily feature-phones, not smart-phones. This web site itself, exposed here via
        Admin pages, is mostly meant
        for administrators rather than general people using smart phones or desktop browsers,
        although it could be quite easily re-purposed for such usage.</p>
