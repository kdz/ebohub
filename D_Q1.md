### EboHub ###

EboHub is an online web-based application to assist health-care workers, patients, and administrators coordinate disease surveillance and management on the frontlines of the battle against Ebola.

### The Problem and Constraints ###

The [Ebola outbreak](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28755033) that started in 2014 is the deadliest outbreak in the history of the disease. The disease spread like wildfire, and the outbreak region had none of the infrastructure to tackle it rapidly and effectively. 

Major problems included:

  - Ebola patients could only be handled by suitably equipped response centers
  - There were few ways to dissiminate information and reach out to local communities
  - There was no central coordinated surveillance system that connected to the public
  - Healthcare workers were recording patient, disease, and lab data on paper
  - Telecomm infrastructure was for feature phones (SMS-based) without web access
