### Additional Information ###

EboHub began as a idea at Columbia University's Ebola Design Challenge in early September, 2014. After attending a moving talk about the ravages of the (then) young epidemic, I teamed with a few others to work on a solution. My team had a current Sierra Leone healthcare worker, back from his first round of service; a business school alum; a microbiology Ph.D. candidate; a Biotech masters student; and a sophomore in my school. I was the sole designer and developer of the EboHub application.

I started developing EboHub in mid-September 2014. As it progressed, I got feedback from my team, from other groups including the NYU hackathon, and from [OpenIdeo](https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/fighting-ebola/ideas/sms-civilian-helpline-and-disease-surveillance-system/comments#comments-section).

It was built under time constraint from Columbia and NYU competitions, and racing against the epidemicÂ and keeping up with course work. I have worked on it for about 8 months now, through several iterations with feedback from healthcare workers (including the one on my team) and from the *There Is No Limit* foundation, an NGO based in Guinea. As of Summer 2015, EboHub was being prepared for piloting in Guinea by *There Is No Limit*. This NGO and I applied for USAID funding but did not make it past the 2nd round.

### Evolution of EboHub ###

Here are some of my sketches of how the EboHub concept evolved over time, starting from that first Columbia meeting.

### The Future of EboHub ###

It is currently not clear if EboHub will be developed further. My NGO partner has contacts in Guinea healthcare and telecommunications who are interested in taking it further. However, there are now other solutions deployed in the region, and the health-care infrastructure for Ebola has been improved considerably. I have not decided whether to evolve it in the direction of a general disease surveillance platform for under-developed countries, but will willingly work further if the need arises. 

Some of the top current TODO items as of Summer 2015 include:

  - Full support contact-tracing
  - Integrate with iHRIS health-facility databases (e.g. where are beds available?) with 2-day data feeds
  - Internationalize the application (both SMS and Web interfaces)
  - Hardware interface to a GSM modem for regions that do not even have SMS-infrastructure

It was, overall, an awesome experience.
